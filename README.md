Title: Basketball Scoreboard

Description: 
This is a project I have created as part of a Javascript course in order to demonstrate the knowledge I have gained regarding the Javascript concepts of functions, incrementing/decrementing, event listeners and basic manipulation of the DOM. The program is based on a basketball scoreboard and increases a score depending on which button has been pressed, there is also a new game button which resets the score.


Tools utilised: 
Visual Studio Code IDE.
The Coolers website to get a range of colours to use for the project.
